1. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount. Use a timer to calculate the discount after a delay, since the discount must be calculated only after bill validation.

In this example, I have used setTimeout callback function to calculate the bill amount after discount, which will execute after 2000 microsec which allows validateBillAmount function to execute first.

Use a timer to calculate the discount after a delay, since the discount must be calculated only after bill validation. Make the callback as an error first callback.

By using Error First callbacks:

It is similar as if else statement which returns/executes the block of code once condition satisfies. here we have named it as error.
 we are passing error string during call of function.
