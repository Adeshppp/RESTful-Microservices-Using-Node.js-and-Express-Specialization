# Week 4

1. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount. Use a timer to calculate the discount after a delay, since the discount must be calculated only after bill validation.

In this example, I have used setTimeout callback function to calculate the bill amount after discount, which will execute after 2000 microsec which allows validateBillAmount function to execute first.


2. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount.
Use a timer to calculate the discount after a delay, since the discount must be calculated only after bill validation. Make the callback as an error first callback.

By using Error First callbacks:

It is similar as if else statement which returns/executes the block of code once condition satisfies. here we have named it as error.
 we are passing error string during call of function.

3. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount.
Use Promises to achieve asynchronous programming.

4. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount. Use Promise chaining to validate the bill and then calculate the total bill amount.

5. Write a program to calculate the total bill after discount. Accept as input the bill amount and discount percentage. Validate the bill before calculating the discount. Use async/await to validate the bill and then calculate the total bill amount.
